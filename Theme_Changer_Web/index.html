        <p>Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text used in graphic design and publishing. It's a short paragraph that contains all the letters of the alphabet. The characters are spread out evenly so that the reader's attention is focused on the layout of the text instead of its content. 
            Lorem ipsum is the most-used dummy text excerpt. It's Latin, which means your average reader won't get distracted by trying to read it. It has a fairly normal distribution of letters and words, making it look like normal English. 
            Lorem ipsum is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It has survived five centuries and the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
